# How many level deep can pointer to pointer go?

Theoritically there can be an infinite number of pointer to pointer chain.

Practically this is limited by the amount of memory available to store all these pointers.&#x20;

That said, C++ implies no limitation from its size to the number of pointer to pointer chain.
