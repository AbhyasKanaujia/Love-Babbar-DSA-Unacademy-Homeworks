# 7. Explain do while loop

The `do while` loop is a variation of the `while` loop with the difference that the loop is executed at least once even when the condition is false.

Syntax:

```cpp
do
{
  // code
} while (condition);
```

Note: There is a semi-colon at the end of the loop unlike other looping constructs.
