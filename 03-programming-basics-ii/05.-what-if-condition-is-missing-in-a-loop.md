# 05. What if condition is missing in a loop?



**While Loop**: If condition is missing in while loop then the compiler will throw an **error** as it **expects** an **expression** inside the parenthesis of the while loop.

```cpp
// Compiler Error: Missing expression before ')'
while()
{
  // code
}
```

**For Loop**: If condition is missing in the for loop then it turns into an infinite loop. The presence of `;;` inside the for loop satisfies the compiler to not make it throw an error.

```cpp
// Infinite Loop
for(;;)
{
  // code
}
```
