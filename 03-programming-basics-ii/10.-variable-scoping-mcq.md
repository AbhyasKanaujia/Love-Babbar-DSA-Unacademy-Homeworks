# 10. Variable Scoping MCQ

#### Variable Scoping Question 1

```cpp
int i;
for (i = 0;i < 5; i++)
  int a = i;
printf("%d", a);
```

Variable `a` is declared inside the `for` loop and is not accessible outside the loop.

The code snipped throws an error.

#### Variable Scoping Question 2

Which variable has the longest scope?

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int b;
int main()
{
  int c;
  return 0;
}
int a;
```

<details>

<summary>Solution</summary>

`b`. It was declared at the beginning of the program and is valid till the end. `c` only lives inside `main` and `a` is declared at the very end.

So, **`b`** has the longest scope.

#### Variable Scoping Question 3

Choose the correct option

```cpp
#include <stdio.h> //Program 1
int main()
{
  int a;
  int b;
  int c;
}

#include <stdio.h> //Program 2
int main()
{
  int a;
  {
    int b;
  }
  {
    int c;
  }
}
```

1. Both are same &#x20;
2. Scope of c is till the end of the main function in Program 2 &#x20;
3. In Program 1, variables a, b and c can be used anywhere in the main function whereas in Program 2, variables b and c can be used only inside their respective blocks &#x20;
4. None of the mentioned
